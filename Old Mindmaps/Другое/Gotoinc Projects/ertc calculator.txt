Okay, so we want to solve his problems in the shortest amount of time possible.
To do that we need to understand the full picture.
WHAT the project IS.
  During the Covid Pandemic, all the employees were sitting at home and not working. And their employers (companies) had to pay full-time salaries even though they did not have any income.
  Now when the Pandemic is over, the US government provided a couple of government refund programs (basically giving the companies back the money that they had to pay to employees during the Pandemic)
  There are two Refund programs: 1) PPP (Payroll Protection Program) 2) ERTC (Employee Retention Tax Credit)
  The legal procedure is that to get the refund money from the Government, the company has to just fill in the PDF document called Amended Form 941-X (issued by IRS).
  After the company submits Amended Form 941-X it can get a full or partial refund (not sure how much, some sources say $7000 per person, other sources say 100% of salary paid during a pandemic).
  Same as in Ukraine, the US Government does not fill in your documents for you, they only give the template documents and check if you filled them incorrectly,  if so - accepts them. And rejects if there are errors. 
  Because US companies are constantly trying to abuse the system to get as much as they can, the ERTC & PPP formulas of the eligibility are constantly changing. The rules of "how to get the money and how much you can get" are constantly changing in these documents:
    The formulas and eligibility requirements get constantly changed by the US government in these documents:
    American Rescue Plan Act of 2021
    CARES Act
    Families First Act
    Payroll & Healthcare Enhancement Act
    PPP Payroll Flexibility Act
    the Consolidated Appropriations Act.
    IRS Interpretations and FAQ’s
  The main job of our client is to constantly read all these laws and to calculate the amounts of money companies can claim using the latest versions of the formulas. This is "his secret product" and the only thing that gives value to the project.
  From this step so far I can say a couple of his biggest strategic errors:
    The first mistake in his planning. We only want to make him be able to edit the "input data" (company name, payrolls last names, wages, etc). We DO NOT want him to be able to edit data generated by formulas, because this introduces human error. This is why a little bit later I will say that instead of doing a "multistep editing process" we should do "3 layout views with inline editing of data he is allowed to change".
    The second mistake in his planning: Covid will sooner or later end. The US Government will sooner or later change the formulas of how much they are willing to refund, or they will close the refund program completely.  I will later mention, that the client is an Accountant / Dentist. This is why I assume that when the moment comes that ERTC & PPP programs stop refunding, he will try to sell other types of PDF reports (I assume there will be many refund programs in the US, some of the refund programs will be available only in specific states, some reports may be tied to a specific country if for example the ever decides to open the same service in France or something). Or maybe it will become an online accounting/audit platform. Given all that, I think we should provide a) the ability for him to edit formulas, b) the ability to upload other Government PDF templates - not just Amended Form 941-X, and find a way to program to fill in the data into the correct PDF areas. He will also have to figure out legal Terms & Conditions that would allow him not to be financially responsible if the formulas he enters do not give his companies the money from the Government.
    I have seen the phrase that they "use the formulas that maximize the refund" (which probably strengthens my thought that maybe he wants to change his formulas a little bit to tweak the results of how much he can get from the government).
 
WHO is the Client
  The client is an Accountant with 10 years of experience - slash - dentist (from the info on his website).
  Around March 2021 he saw (in his accounting information sources etc.) that 2 months prior the Government started refunding money to the companies for the Covid pandemic. 
  Because he is an accountant with 10 years of experience, he called the long list of his old clients and offered them his service of "helping to get the refunds from the government". 
  Probably he received their accounting Excel sheets, did a bit of his own data manipulation, and filled in the Amended Form 941-X PDF for them.
  Because there was interest in this service, he decided to open a company around it and created a basic WordPress landing page with his phone number.
  And now, 6 months later, he reached a point when he realized that he faced technical limitations in scaling (because of his primitive approaches in solving it), and he realized that he needs qualified technical help from the experts, so he called us.
  He is a "mom & pop shop". A 1-person expert who has seen some basic automation in Excel (he's very good at it, I assume VBA scripts are made by him). But I assume that we can help him realize what the project CAN become, and kindly introduce him to sit at one table with "the big boys".
  We have to very carefully suggest him the following shift.  We have to tell him that we can help him establish himself as a company, who helps other companies to generate the PDF forms required to get money from the Government according to various government programs. (based on their complicated accounting data and complicated laws).
  After we build the platform how I describe it, he probably will need to worry about only his "secret sauce" (read the legal documents in the accounting and convert them into the formulas that he will need to keep up to date).
  We have to help his "mom & pop shop" to reach the "next step" of the project (the industrial-level platform with high load, responsibility for the finances of more companies that he ever worked with, etc, this is what his initial request to "fully automate" truly means)
Repetitive Problems
  The laws are constantly changing. So he needs to update his formulas constantly (based on all the laws mentioned above).
  Human errors (typos in the names, salaries, dates, etc). This is exactly why I think we should provide the ability to only edit the input data and forbid editing the results generated by formulas.
  This change simplifies the architecture a lot. Because we do not need now to let him "reupload & change the excel sheets in Step 1, Step 2, Step 3, etc". The overall picture should be the following: The Client enters his input data, he MAY have 3 buttons (different layouts the client is used to), and the PDF button. But they are not "steps". They are different layout representations and calculations based on the same data the client already entered. 
Repetitive Processes
  3 types of logins
    Client/Accountant
    Manager
    Administrator
  Ability by the Client to create a "Block/Dataset" of data (client has many datasets)
  Ability by the Client to enter different information into Block/Dataset
    Company name
    Company Address
    Company Owners
    Company Owner Relatives (may be mistaken on this one, not clear, maybe he wants a list of employees and their relatives)
    Payroll (which is a list of transactions) with the following columns:
      Recipient Name
      Amount
      Date Period
  The ability for the client to "Request Amended Form 941-X" for a given Dataset, and the ability for the Manager to Approve the PDF download (i.e. initially for the Client, the Download Amended Form 941-X button is blocked, and there is another button "Request Review", the review gets sent to the Manager, if the manager thinks everything is OK he Approves, and then the Download PDF button for the client is active). I'm not sure here. because we can use validations here and cut out the middle man. We can for example make a "Download PDF" a Paid button instead - "it is up to the client to fill in the data correctly, click Download, fill in the Credit Card form and pay the fee, and download your finished report)
  Ability to create/edit the formulas by the client without us (we have to discuss the best way to do it, because using ruby-eval is a bad practice, and keeping this processing in VBA sounds silly, maybe he will tell these formulas to us from time to time and we will need to hardcode them)
  Calculating the data points according to the client's formulas.
  Show the information in different layouts (presented by the client) - i.e. Button 1 for Layout 1, Button 2 for Layout 2, etc - NOT Excel, just basic HTML layouts with inline editing features in places which he is allowed to edit (explained above why).
  The process of filling in PDF with the calculated data.
  Communicate the details about the dataset between the Client and the Manager (i.e. dataset has many comments from managers, clients, and administrators)
Main User Stories
  Guest
    Sign up
  User/Client/Accountant
    When I log in I can create a dataset.
    When I log in I can open a dataset and insert their data about my company, employees, etc.
    When I log in I can open the dataset in several layouts (each layout is similar to the excel sheets submitted by our clients, and each one has inline editing options for the data that I am allowed to edit - i.e. user-inserted data, and not the data generated by formulas)
    When I log in and open the dataset I can't download PDF but I can send the Request Amended Form 941-X button (and probably pay for that report)
    When I log in and the manager approved my report I can download the PDF
    When I open the dataset I can leave the comments under it (and some managers will answer)
    Every time I modify the data in my dataset, it requires a new Approval (to download a new PDF)
    When I click Logout, I logout
  Manager and Administrator
    When I log in I see all the clients
    When I open the client page I see his datasets
    When I open the client page I see his requests for approval (in which datasets there are requests)
    I can leave comments (and the Client will be notified about them?)
    I can open the client's dataset and see the data, open layouts, inline edit them, etc.
    I can Approve the requested PDF Report
    When I click Logout, I Logout
  Administrator (only)
    When I log in I see the managers
    When I log in I see the clients
    I can see clients' datasets
    Create/Edit formulas? (again, I have no idea what is the best way to do it, if we need to hardcode them then we need to try and convince him to share his formulas with us, NDA, etc).
    Create/Edit Different types of PDF reports? (probably this will require way too much technical detail for him, so he probably will need to find a way to trust us in his project and collaborate long term - ask us to update the formulas, etc).
